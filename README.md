# 🎯 Pinko Web Application

A fun and interactive **Plinko game** built with modern web technologies. Play the game or run large-scale simulations to explore randomness and probability distributions visually.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with TypeScript), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)

## 🧪 Running the App Locally

### Start the backend server

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Start the frontend React app

In another terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173`, and the backend will be at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🧠 Simulation Mode

Use the simulation mode to run thousands of Plinko drops at once and analyze where the balls land most frequently. This mode is ideal for demonstrating the bell curve distribution and concepts of probability.
